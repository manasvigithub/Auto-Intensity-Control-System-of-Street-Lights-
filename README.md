OVERVIEW
- Implemented an Arduino based system utilizing a combination of RTC Module (DS3231) and LDR for controlling the street lights.
- It is designed to automatically adjust the intensity of street lights depending on the ambient lighting conditions in order to save energy to some extent.


INTRODUCTION

Auto Intensity Control of Street Lights is a simple project where the intensity of the street lights is automatically controlled based on the sunlight conditions. 
Generally, street lights are turned on during evening time and continue to glow till morning. This might result is unnecessary usage of power as the lights will be 
glowing at full intensity all the times. But employing the Auto Intensity Control of Street Lights using Arduino project, you can control the intensity based on 
the ambient lighting conditions.
As an additional power saving feature, LEDs have been used for street lights.
